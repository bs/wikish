[ultrawide](https://www.lg.com/us/monitors/lg-49WL95C-W-ultrawide-monitor)
monitor. I've had my doubts as last I looked they seemed to be pretty hacky.

## Initial research
People seem to be really into

And also Phoenix  
https://github.com/fabiospampinato/phoenix - a good phoenix config


Downloaded Rectangle

Seems like a really easy to use spiritual successor to Spectacle


Hamerspoon is still around which is very cool. Here's an example config

I'm using Hammerspoon on MaOS to give me a semi-tileable windows interface. Here is my config:

    local hyper = {"ctrl", "alt", "cmd"}

    hs.loadSpoon("MiroWindowsManager")

    hs.window.animationDuration = 0.3
    spoon.MiroWindowsManager:bindHotkeys({
      up = {hyper, "up"},
      right = {hyper, "right"},
      down = {hyper, "down"},
      left = {hyper, "left"},
      fullscreen = {hyper, "f"}
    })

This allows me to place any MacOS window in either a horizontal or vertical third, or a quadrant, or a half, perfectly divided in such a way that I can maximise use of my screen while running multiple apps. My most common work environment is to have a terminal on one half of the screen, docs on the other - or two terms on top of each other on one side, docs on the other.

This is so useful for me that I yearn to make the same hotkeys work on my Linux machine, but I haven't worked out what window manager I want to use to do it .. probably Awesome of course, but I'd love to be able to use the same Hammerspoon scripts (Lua) somehow ..

Also Hyperswitch (not sure what this is) w/ Hammerspoon?  

[Amethyst](https://ianyh.com/amethyst/) is still around.
